# asio-poker

The purpose of this project is to solidify my networking knowledge, and gain more experience coding in C/C++
Also, I think it would be fun to play poker with my friends on-demand without having to pay for it/use a service. 

High-level goals of the project: 
- Basics; server + client -> server + client**s**
- Managing networking and using a framework; ASIO C++ library
- Security; implementing encrypted traffic & writing safe code
